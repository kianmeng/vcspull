# Migration notes

Migration and deprecation notes for vcspull are here, see {ref}`changelog` as
well.

```{admonition} Welcome on board! 👋
1. 📌 For safety, **always** pin the package
2. 📖 Check the migration notes _(You are here)_
3. 📣 If you feel something got deprecated and it interrupted you - past, present, or future - voice your opinion on the [tracker].

   We want to make vcspull fun, reliable, and useful for users.

   API changes can be painful.

   If we can do something to draw the sting, we'll do it. We're taking a balanced approach. That's why these notes are here!

   (Please pin the package. 🙏)

## Next release

_Notes on the upcoming release will be added here_

<!-- Maintainers, insert changes / features for the next release here -->

## vcspull 1.15.0 (2022-10-09)

**Completions have changed** (#400)

Completions now use a different tool: [shtab]. See the [completions page] for more information.

If you were using earlier versions of vcspull (earlier than 1.15.0), you may need to uninstall the old completions, first.
